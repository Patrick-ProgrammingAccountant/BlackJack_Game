# BlackJack_Game
This project is intended to create a game as close to the game of BlackJack as possible.

This project showcases the manipulation of dictionary items.  Specifically, the random selection of an item in the dictionary, adding it to a list for further calculation, then removing the item from the dictionary.  This closely simulates the drawing of a random card from a deck.  Since the removal of the item will prevent it from being drawn again once a new card is drawn from the deck afterwards.
