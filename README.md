# BlackJack_Game

I combined a simulation of a game of Blackjack with a text based adventure.

In this story, you get swept into a portal and must gamble your way back home.

Showcases: Manipulation of a dictionary and the use of the random module.

Expansion ideas: Program in more gambling games and allow the player to option to choose a new game after each game.
